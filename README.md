# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
During this challenge I had the opportunity to learn a lot about the backend work of javascript and OOP. I will say after the last 2 weeks, I believe I have decided I want to be on the front-end side of coding rather than the backend as my interest level has declined. I think it's extremely important to learn and have the overall backround knowledge all sides of coding, but overall it has been extremely different to follow and understand and I have had to reach out to other resources more than normal.  This is one of the toughest, if not the toughest challenge we've had so far, but with the help of my tutor, professor, TA's, and other students I was able to overcome certain obsticles that were holding me back from progressing. I had to make multiple files in order to accomplish what I wanted to and that was a new experience as well. I was able to build an application based on the requirements that we're being asked of. A couple weeks ago I was completely clueless as to what was going on and this past weeks it's made a little more sense and I'm glad I'm getting to that point where I can try to puzzle pieces together.
